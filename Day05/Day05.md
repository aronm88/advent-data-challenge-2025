## Using the description above, help Santa answer the following questions:

### **Question 1:**  
Which toy category received the highest number of rejections?  
(*WishStatus = Rejected*)

### **Question 2:**  
Which child present in the fact table submitted the fewest wishes?

### **Question 3:**  
What percentage of all wishes have the status **"New"**?

### **Question 4:**  
What was the name of the submission channel (**WishChannelName**) most frequently used by children from Poland?

### **Question 5:**  
What was the longest difference in days between consecutive wishes of a child?

A child may have submitted multiple wishes.  
Example: a child submitted 3 wishes – on 01.12.2025, 03.12.2025, and 20.12.2025.  
The differences between consecutive wishes are **2 days** and **17 days**.  
So, for that child, the longest gap is **17 days**.

You must calculate this for all children in the fact table and find the **maximum** gap.
